# Code Style Translation - Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully translated all Russian comments and documentation to English while maintaining Russian for user-facing content.

### 1. Created CONTRIBUTING.md
- Added comprehensive code style guidelines
- Specified that comments and documentation must be in English
- Clarified that user-facing messages and semantic tags remain in Russian
- Provided clear examples of good and bad practices

### 2. Translated Documentation
- `PROJECTS_MANAGEMENT.md` - Fully translated to English
- All technical documentation now in English

### 3. Translated Code Comments
Translated comments in the following files:
- `python/scripts/test_projects.py` - All comments and docstrings
- `python/src/easybuild_bot/bot.py` - Comments about bot commands
- `python/src/easybuild_bot/commands/implementations/unblock_user_command.py` - Parameter pattern comments
- `python/src/easybuild_bot/commands/implementations/block_user_command.py` - Parameter pattern comments
- `python/tests/test_dynamic_commands.py` - Test case comments
- `python/scripts/import_from_hive_json.py` - Setup comments

### 4. Updated README.md
- Added link to CONTRIBUTING.md
- Added code style section

## Important Notes

### What Stays in Russian ✅
- **User-facing messages**: Error messages, success messages, bot responses
- **Semantic tags**: Natural language recognition tags in command classes
- **Bot command descriptions**: Descriptions shown to users in Telegram

### What is Now in English ✅
- **Code comments**: All inline comments explaining code logic
- **Docstrings**: All function and class documentation
- **Documentation files**: Technical documentation in `.md` files
- **Variable/function names**: Already using English naming

## Verification

Verified that no Russian comments remain in Python code:
```bash
grep -r "# [А-Яа-яЁё]" python/ --include="*.py"
# Result: No matches found
```

## Next Steps

All contributors should now:
1. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` before contributing
2. Follow the code style guidelines
3. Write all new comments and documentation in English
4. Keep user-facing messages in Russian
